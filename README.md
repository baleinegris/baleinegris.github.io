Making a website to try to remember how HTML/CSS/JavaScript works since I haven't used them in forever (don't judge me T_T). Might put some stuff up about my projects when I'm taking a break from actually working on them. Anyway life is good. Markdown is kinda fun. Here's an inspirational quote:
<center>"It is sorta cringe to share your opinions on the internet cause it just is but if you don't then you will just die and no one will care This is actually so deep..."</center>
