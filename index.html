                <p>Hi I'm Oscar Heath, aka Baleinegris. What's with the name? Baleinegris is actually French for "Grey Whale"
                 which is just a pseudonym I chose when I was a little kid (there's actually a slight typo in the name but I'm in 
                 too deep to change it now). Right now I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. But yeah for 
                now I'm some some guy and if you're even on my website chances are you already know me :)

            <h2>What's this website for?</h2>
            <p>
                This website is just a small project I'm working on for fun. At the time of making it I haven't used 
                HTML, CSS or JavaScript in a long time so I'm trying to refresh my memory on website design. Plus I get to 
                much around with Git which I haven't done that much of. Also it's
                just somewhere on the internet I can put some of my projects, opinions and updates.
            </p>
